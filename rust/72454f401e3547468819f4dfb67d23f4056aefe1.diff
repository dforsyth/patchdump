 two points, no matter where they were stored. For example, we might like to
 compute the distance between `on_the_stack` and `shared_box`, or between

 define it this way, calling the function will cause the points to be
 copied. For points, this is probably not so bad, but often copies are
 expensive. Worse, if the data type contains mutable fields, copying can change
